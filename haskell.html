            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              &ensp;  Item-based Collaborative Filtering is an algorithm that
              computes item similarity based on ratings or interactions by
              users. With this algorithm, we can recommend users the items they
              might like by computing the similarity between the items they
              actually like and other items they haven’t bought or interacted
              with yet. &ensp; This project implements the Item-based
              Collaborative Filtering algorithm with Haskell. Different types of
              parallelizing strategies are explored and analyzed.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Formulation</h2>
            <p>
              &ensp; In this project, the MovieLens dataset is used. The
              MovieLens dataset provides 100000 ratings (943 users, 1682
              movies). The program will compute the similarities between the
              items, predict the rating of each of them, and recommend a list of
              items to the specified user. The input to the program contains the
              user’s id, the number of items that we wished to used to predict
              the ratings with, and the number of items that we want to
              recommend to the user. The output of the program will simply be a
              list of item ids.
            </p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                First, a Python program is used to read and preprocess the
                MovieLens data into two text files. One of them is the original
                utility matrix, and the other one is the mean-centered matrix.
                Both files contains 1682 rows and 943 columns.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Haskell program reads the matrix text files into two
                Data.Matrix.
              </li>
              <li>
                A list of item id pairs are generated. This is used to compute
                the similarity later. Example look of the lis [(1, 2), (1, 3),
                ..., (1681, 1682)]
              </li>
              <li>
                A function that computes the cosine similarity between items
                will take the list generated in the last step and computes the
                cosine similarity between each items. After the com- putation we
                will get a list of tuples with the items’ ids and the
                similarities between them: [(item1, item2, similarity1,2)...]
              </li>
              <li>
                Obtaining the item similarity map: When we are computing the
                predicted score for an item, we need to be able to access the
                items that are highly similar to it quickly. A map is suitable
                in the situation. With the list of item pairs and similarities
                in the last steps, we can initialize an item similarity map. The
                key of the map is the item’s id, and the value of the map is a
                Heap that that stores tuples of a similarity value and an item
                id.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the queried user, we predicted the ratings of all 1682 items
                and return a list of type [(Rating, ItemId)]
              </li>
              <li>The list [(Rating, ItemId)] is then sorted by the rating.</li>
              <li>
                Items that are already rated by the user will be filtered from
                the list obtained in the previous step. The rating is also
                removed from the list, so we are only getting a list of item ids
                from this step.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the final step, the top k items are recommended to the user.
                k is also a user input for the program.
              </li>
            </ul>
